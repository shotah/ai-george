# Design

Harness contract: principles, env, agent loop, memory, ops, packaging,
security. Pitch and hello path: [root readme](../readme.md). Diagrams:
[architecture.md](architecture.md).

George is an **AI harness** — the runtime around one model so an agent can
**plan on a long horizon**. The model predicts tokens. The harness makes a
turn finish, a tool call land, and a goal survive tomorrow.

## Problem

Platform agent stacks drift toward multi-agent products: multiple providers,
dashboards, console features, config UI. Our deployment model is the opposite:

```text
process = persona + model + MCP set + data dir
```

Want another LLM or persona? Another process (second compose service or
systemd unit). No in-process routing, no dashboard — a harness that does
exactly that and nothing else.

Deploy shapes: [deploy-docker.md](deploy-docker.md) (Hub) ·
[deploy-native.md](deploy-native.md).

## Principles

1. **Stupid simple.** One agent, one model, one channel loop. If a feature
   needs a diagram to explain, it probably belongs in an MCP binary, not here.
2. **Highly performant.** Pure Go, static binary, no CGO, small RSS, no
   background frameworks. Long-poll + goroutines; nothing dials in. Speed is a
   product feature: curated tool schemas, parallel tool batches (progress per
   Completer call), in-process FTS memory (no embedding round-trip), and a
   Gemini 3–compatible tool loop that preserves `thought_signature` so
   multi-step turns finish instead of 400’ing. See **Local-model hardening**
   below.
3. **Highly portable.** `CGO_ENABLED=0` static binary — systemd or Distroless
   (no shell in the image). No glibc dependency in our binary.
4. **Plugin-centric.** Capabilities come from external binaries over MCP
   stdio. The george **is the harness**: it hosts tools; it does not implement
   them (except a few builtins: memory, cron, watch, `self_note`, `web_search`). Import
   libraries over writing our own.
5. **1:1, always.** One process, one CHANNEL mouth, one conversation (`george`),
   one memory/cron/watch set. No multi-provider config, no multi-agent config,
   no peer routing. Scaling = more processes.
6. **Env + files is the config plane.** Secrets and scalars via env. Structure
   via persona markdown, MCP manifest, and a data directory.
7. **Memory is structured and inspectable.** SQLite rows you can read and
   delete with `sqlite3`, not opaque embedding blobs. Persona files always
   outrank recalled memory.
8. **Long-horizon.** The harness holds goals, personality, and work across
   sessions. Memory, cron, watches, history fold, and `SELF.md` are first-class
   — not extras you add when a chatbot gets boring.

## Harness and long-horizon planning

Industry language for what this binary always was.

An **AI harness** is everything around the model at runtime: the tool loop,
MCP host, context bounds, memory, persona, and the channel. The model is a
stateless token predictor. The harness is why a turn finishes, a name typo
still calls the right tool, and yesterday’s aim is still on the board after
`/new`.

**Long-horizon planning** is the goal: hold aims, personality, and work across
days and weeks — not a chatbot that dies when the context window gets
expensive. That is why these pieces live in the harness, not in an MCP:

| Horizon work | What the harness does |
| --- | --- |
| Standing goals | Cron + watches fire the same loop later; the daily planner wakes once to plan the day |
| Personality | `SELF.md` / `self_note` / Voice distill outlive `/new` |
| Facts | SQLite memory + consolidator; persona files outrank recall |
| Context that does not rot | History caps, `Facts:`/`Voice:` fold, tool collapse |
| Turns that actually finish | Tool repair, landing call, local-model hardening |

## Progress per invocation

A Completer invocation is the expensive unit. The **completed objective** is
what we optimize. The horizon is the unit of *product*.

Stop optimizing turns. Optimize **progress per model invocation**.

The standing prompt (persona, history, schemas) is re-billed every Completer
call. Serial lookups — think → tool → think → tool — multiply that prefix and
invite recovery loops. Independent work belongs in one batch:

```text
context → plan the next state transition → fan out tools → consolidate → repeat
```

That is why these pieces live in the harness:

| Piece | Trajectory job |
| --- | --- |
| Compact persona | Stable behavioral prior without eating context |
| SQLite memory | Don't rediscover the world every round |
| Caps, collapse, `mcp_enable` | Enough context for a large decision, not everything |
| Parallel tool batches | Maximize work between Completer calls |
| MCP | Expand the action surface without stuffing tools into the prompt |
| Go runtime | Actual concurrent execution of a batch |
| Cron / watches / `SELF.md` | Preserve trajectory across days |
| Token accounting | Trajectory cost (invocations × prefix), not tokens on one call |

A slightly more expensive individual round can be a dramatically cheaper
trajectory. `/perf` records the comparison: invocations, tools, max batch,
recoveries, prompt/gen estimates, wall time, outcome.

A single chat turn is still how one user message *executes*. The horizon is
still why the loop exists. We named it; we did not invent a second architecture.

## Who it’s for

Anyone who wants `docker compose up` (or systemd + Ollama) and a long-horizon
agent on their phone. Anti-fit: web UI, team workspace, inbound webhooks,
no-code canvases, “Cursor for the company.” Those are other products. A yard
console for several agents is [gantree](https://github.com/shotah/gantree).

## Non-goals

- Web dashboard, gateway, REST/WS API, pairing flows
- Multi-agent / multi-provider / model fallback chains
- Built-in workspace tools (those are MCP binaries)
- Vector DB / embedding service
- In-process sandboxing / risk profiles (the container is the sandbox;
  channel allowlist is the gate)

Cron, watches, and the daily planner are env-driven. Streaming: `STREAM_REPLIES=true`.

## Local-model hardening

Most agent stacks assume frontier cloud models and huge tool catalogs. This
harness is hardened where 4–30B local models actually fail — and the same
levers cut prompt tokens on Flash/ChatGPT (schemas, history, and tool results
are re-billed every turn). Long-horizon work is worthless if a mid-chain
tool turn 400s.

| Lever | What we do | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tool surface | Manifest filters + MCP `--tool-tier` | Smaller schemas → better tool picks |
| Name repair | Prefix alias/rebuild, closest-name hints, then a grammar-constrained retry | `google_search__…` still lands |
| Think stalls | Promote CoT → reply after tools | Multi-step turns finish instead of ERROR |
| Printed calls | Parse a tool call written as text and run it | A model that prints `{"name":…}` never speaks JSON at you |
| Multi-bubble | Steer + settle (`COALESCE_SETTLE_MS`) | Follow-ups join the live turn; MCP calls kept |
| Memory | SQLite + FTS5 in-process | No embedding API before every reply |
| Personality | `SELF.md` + `self_note` + distill on `/new` | The funny agent survives resets |
| Runtime | One static binary (systemd *or* Distroless) | No Node/Bun/gateway in the path |
| Gemini 3 | Preserves `thought_signature` on tool rounds | Cloud multi-step turns don't 400 |

MCP tools share one `{server}__{tool}` name and one repair path. Details:
[mcp.md](mcp.md) · [deploy-native.md](deploy-native.md).

## Configuration contract

Everything is env or a mount. No config UI, no `config set`, no sync step.
Boot is fail-fast: missing required env = clear error + exit 1.

### Environment variables

| `WEB_SEARCH_ENABLED` | no | `true` (builtin `web_search`; leftover `google-search` MCP grants are omitted) |

Source of truth is `internal/config/config.go`. Add new vars here in the same
change.

### MCP manifest (the one file)

Lists of processes don't fit env vars. TOML, mounted read-only. If a server is
listed, the agent gets it — the process composition **is** the grant.

```toml
[[server]]
name    = "google"
command = "google-mcp"
args    = ["--preset", "everyday"]
auth_args = ["auth"]
download_tag = "latest"
download_url = "https://github.com/shotah/google-mcp/releases/download/{tag}/google-mcp_{version}_{os}_{arch}.tar.gz"
# tools   = ["calendar_list_events"]  # optional allowlist
# exclude = ["raw_*"]                 # optional denylist
```

`download_url` + `download_tag` feed `george tools-fetch`. Placeholders:
`{os}` `{arch}` `{tag}` `{version}` (`version` = tag without leading `v`).
`george tools-plan` prints the resolved inventory without downloading.
Optional `auth_command` / `auth_args` drive `george auth <name>` and chat
`/auth` — [auth.md](auth.md), [deploy-docker.md](deploy-docker.md#mcp-tool-auth-browser-oauth).

Listed servers still **start**; `tools` / `exclude` only filter what is
**published** to the model. Tool names are always `{server}__{tool}`. Local
models often rewrite the prefix; the host repairs unambiguous mistakes.
Full contract: **[mcp.md](mcp.md)**.

### Host layout

Same three directories whether Docker bind-mounts them or systemd points at
`/opt/george/…`:

| Role | Typical path |
| --- | --- |
| Persona markdown | `PERSONA_DIR` → `/persona` or `/opt/george/persona` |
| MCP manifest | `MCP_MANIFEST` → `/etc/george/mcp.toml` or `/opt/george/mcp.toml` |
| SQLite + secrets | `DATA_DIR` → `/data` or `/opt/george/data` |

Only `PERSONA.md` (you) then `SELF.md` (the agent) load. Extra `*.md` is
ignored. Missing files are tolerated; empty persona is allowed but unusual.
Boot migrates leftover `SOUL.md` / `RULES.md` / `USER.md` / `TOOLS.md` into
`PERSONA.md` if needed, then deletes them. MCP tool names belong in the live
catalog, not persona. Keep `PERSONA.md` short.

## Agent loop & context bounds

This is the heart of the harness. Keep it boring and bounded. A long-horizon
agent is still one turn at a time; the loop is how those turns chain without
losing the plot:

1. **Assemble prompt**: `PERSONA.md` + `SELF.md` + memory hydration + session
   history (bounded) + user message. MCP names are **not** in persona.
2. **Call model** with MCP tool schemas (loaded eagerly at boot; refreshed on
   server restart; this is the live catalog).
3. **Tool iteration**: execute a **batch** via the MCP host (independent
   calls run concurrently; same-server stdio still serializes). Repair
   unambiguous prefix mistakes, else suggest closest real names *and*
   constrain the next call to them. Truncate each result to
   `TOOL_RESULT_MAX_CHARS`. Loop until final text or `TOOL_MAX_ITERATIONS`.
   At ~70% of the budget the model is told how many rounds remain; at the
   cap one landing call runs with tools withheld so the turn ends in a real
   reply. Each call appends a trace line to a streaming reply so long
   chains show motion.
4. **Reply** on the channel; append turn to session.

Every objective logs its trajectory: `model call`, `tool done`, and `turn perf`
(`source`, `user_id`, `session_id`, `iterations`, `tool_calls`, `max_batch`, `recoveries`, `prompt_est_tokens`,
`gen_est_tokens`, native `prompt_tokens` / `completion_tokens` / `total_tokens` when the Completer sent `usage`,
`model`, `finish_reason`, `model_ms` / `tool_ms` / `total_ms`, `outcome`). On local
models the model/tool split is still which half to attack —
[deploy-native.md](deploy-native.md#latency-measure-before-tuning). `/perf`
shows the same numbers in chat.

| Mechanism | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| History caps | Drop oldest past `HISTORY_MAX_MESSAGES` / `HISTORY_MAX_TOKENS` (chars/4 **estimate**). Prompt-only filler strip on user messages older than the last 40; assistant turns stay verbatim. SQLite is not rewritten. |
| Rolling summary | Trimmed turns fold into `session.summary` (`Facts:` + `Voice:`) via the same LLM; Voice copies forward; reinjected later |
| Tool truncate | Each MCP/memory tool result capped at `TOOL_RESULT_MAX_CHARS` |
| Tool collapse | Tool payloads from rounds older than the last 2 tool rounds become one-line markers; matching tool-call args are stubbed. A round is one model-emitted batch, so a three-call batch is read back whole. Session history never stores tool payloads. |
| Iteration cap | `TOOL_MAX_ITERATIONS` Completer rounds with tools, then one landing call with tools withheld |

`/new` wipes the session. `Voice:` folds into `SELF.md` (when self-notes are
enabled). `Facts:` park as a memory episode — `PERSONA.md` is operator-owned and
is never written. Existing memory rows stay.

### Self-notes (`SELF.md`)

Persona files describe who the agent **should** be. `SELF.md` is who it
**became** with you — and unlike chat history, it outlives `/new`.

- Lives in `PERSONA_DIR`, loaded in the stable prompt prefix (`PERSONA.md` →
  `SELF.md`).
- Mid-chat: `self_note` appends one short line.
- On history trim: new `Voice:` bits append the same way.
- On `/new`: distill **merges** into `SELF.md` (keep quoted jokes and
  nicknames). A bland tool session without Voice does not rewrite the file.
- Cap ~4KB; at capacity the tool (and trim append) refuse until distill or
  you prune.
- Needs a **writable** persona directory (`SELF_NOTES_ENABLED`, default on).
  Docker `:ro` silently disables the feature.
- **North-star aims** (how you show up for months) may live here as a few
  sentences. Progress, dates, and open loops are SQLite (`insight` /
  `aim/<area>`), not this file.

**Operator duty:** audit or delete `SELF.md` if the agent drifts.
Write a tight `PERSONA.md` (examples, no MCP catalog).

## Memory design

Long-horizon planning needs facts that outlive a session. Direction taken
from Google's Always-On Memory Agent (2026): **no embeddings, no vector DB —
an LLM writes structured rows into SQLite and a background job consolidates
them.** At personal-agent scale, structured + FTS5 beats ANN search and stays
greppable/deletable. Open the file with `sqlite3`.

### Store

One SQLite file `$DATA_DIR/george.db` (WAL mode), pure-Go driver:

```sql
CREATE TABLE memory (
  id          INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  kind        TEXT NOT NULL,       -- fact | preference | person | episode | insight
  subject     TEXT NOT NULL,
  content     TEXT NOT NULL,
  source      TEXT NOT NULL,       -- chat | consolidation | operator
  confidence  REAL DEFAULT 1.0,
  created_at  TEXT NOT NULL,
  updated_at  TEXT NOT NULL,
  expires_at  TEXT,
  superseded_by INTEGER
);
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE memory_fts USING fts5(subject, content, content=memory);
```

### Builtin tools (only non-MCP tools)

| Tool | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `memory_store` | Atomic `kind` / `subject` / `content`. Months-scale plans: `insight` / `aim/<area>` ([persona.md](persona.md#where-the-horizon-lives)) |
| `memory_recall` | FTS5 + recency |
| `memory_forget` | By id or query — memory must be correctable |

Auto-save is **off**. Auto-saved hallucinations are worse than no memory. The
model stores deliberately; the consolidator promotes.

### Consolidation

A timer job (default 30 min, `0` disables) runs a bounded pass with the
**chat** LLM (same `LLM_*` Completer):

1. Read unconsolidated `episode` rows (batch of 20).
2. Extract durable `fact`/`preference`/`person`/`insight` rows.
3. On bad/empty model JSON, bump attempts and retry; quarantine after 3
   failures. Explicit `[]` marks the batch done.

Builtin backend only (`MEMORY_BACKEND=mcp:…` skips consolidator).

### Read path (hydration)

At session start and on `memory_recall`, hydrate at most ~30 rows: active
facts/preferences + FTS5 hits for the current message, rendered as a compact
`[memory]` block.

**Persona precedence is law**: anything in `PERSONA.md` outranks memory;
contradictions get surfaced, not obeyed.

### Why not vectors

- One user, one process: hundreds–thousands of rows, not millions. FTS5 +
  recency + kind filters is enough and is debuggable.
- Embeddings add a second model, cache, and dimension migration.
- Cloud vector stores add network, cost, and privacy surface to the most
  sensitive data in the system.
- Escape hatch: schema can grow an `embedding BLOB` later behind the same
  `memory_recall` interface.

## Ops surface

**The chat is the console.** A dashboard is a second interface — its own auth,
its own port (banned here), its own deploy story. Ops live in slash commands
and the tool trace in the reply bubble. Host-level questions (RAM/VRAM, GPU
residency) stay one `ssh` away ([deploy-native.md](deploy-native.md#host-signals)).

| Command / signal | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `george run` | Daemon (default) |
| `george status` | Exit 0 if heartbeat fresh (≤ ~60s); JSON doctor on stdout; Docker healthcheck. `george doctor` is an alias. |
| `george version` | Build ldflags |
| SIGTERM / Interrupt | Stop channel → drain in-flight turn → close MCP → close DB |
| Logs | JSON `slog` on stderr (`journalctl` / `docker logs`) |
| Chat cmds | `/new` `/cancel` `/status` `/tools` `/examples` `/planner` `/perf` `/memstats` `/toolstats` `/tokens` `/auth` `/help` |
| SIGHUP | Reloads persona (unix) |
| Multi-bubble | Steer + settle (`COALESCE_SETTLE_MS`, default 2s): Completer cancelled, MCP kept |
| Spin-up notice | `SPINUP_NOTICE_MS` (default 4s) posts a working line before the first token |
| Photos | Inbound → vision; outbound `SendPhoto` for image URLs in the reply |

Telegram refreshes the `/` menu on every bot start (`setMyCommands`). Headless
tool OAuth: [auth.md](auth.md).

Dev: `make build|test|lint|run|ci|check`; `make install-hooks` for pre-commit.

No port is opened by the harness, ever.

## Packaging

- Go ≥ 1.26, single module, `CGO_ENABLED=0`, `-trimpath -ldflags="-s -w"`.
- Targets: `linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`.
- Image: multi-stage → `gcr.io/distroless/static-debian12:nonroot` (ca-certs +
  tzdata, uid 65532, **no shell**). Healthchecks must use exec form
  (`["CMD","george","status"]`), never `CMD-SHELL`. MCP children must be
  static binaries too.
- CI: `go vet`, `golangci-lint`, `go test ./internal/... ./cmd/...` with
  coverage; on `main`, the badge is pushed to `gh-pages`.
- Release: `make release` (or `BUMP=minor|major` / `TAG=vX.Y.Z`);
  `.github/workflows/release.yml` runs GoReleaser on `v*` tags.
- Images: `.github/workflows/docker.yml` pushes multi-arch Distroless to
  `shotah/george` (Hub) and `ghcr.io/shotah/george` — `:latest` and
  `:edge` on `main`, plus semver on `v*` tags. Hub overview syncs from
  [`dockerhub.md`](dockerhub.md) (PNG banner; root readme is the pitch, not
  the Hub page).

## Decisions

Why these stuck (the alternatives are in the same rows):

1. **Name: george** — the coding assistant. Binary `george`. One process,
   one local model, stdin/stdout.
2. **One OpenAI-compat client** — Gemini, ChatGPT, Ollama already speak that
   shape. A provider registry is multi-agent platform gravity.
3. **Token counting: chars/4 estimates**, labeled as estimates. No tokenizer dep.
4. **Memory: builtin SQLite**, `MEMORY_BACKEND=mcp:<name>` escape hatch. No
   vector DB. Auto-save **off**.
5. **Horizon state: three layers** — north-stars in `SELF.md`, progress in
   SQLite, wakes in cron/watch. No `goal` memory kind.
6. **Streaming replies: on by default** (`STREAM_REPLIES=true`). Cron push stays
   buffered.
7. **Channel auth: allowlist only** — empty allowlist fails boot. No pairing.
8. **Runtime image: distroless/static-debian12:nonroot** — MCP children static too.
9. **Logs on stderr** — stdout stays clean for the stdio REPL.
10. **Health is `george status`** (SQLite heartbeat, exit code). No listen port.
11. **The daily planner is horizon work** — one clock time, full tool loop;
    `[silent]` on a sick day or vacation. Do not invent a first aim.
12. **Watches are a cursor + poll** — quiet ticks never call the Completer.

**Rejected:** pairing codes; `parallel_tool_calls` on every Completer request
(Gemini 400s); embeddings in the hot path; stuffing MCP catalogs or project
plans into `PERSONA.md` / `SELF.md`.

## Security

Personal harness, full tool autonomy inside a container. `$DATA_DIR` and
`PERSONA_DIR` are the crown jewels. No in-process permission framework — the
container is the sandbox; the allowlist is the gate.

| Actor | What we care about |
| --- | --- |
| Random chat user | Talk to the bot / burn quota |
| Compromised allowlisted account | Abuse mounted tools as the operator |
| Malicious or buggy MCP binary | Exfil secrets, escape container |
| Prompt injection via a tool result | Coerce calls or memory writes |
| Host / volume attacker | Read `george.db`, `.env`, `/secrets` |

**Controls that ship:** outbound-only (no listen port); allowlist on every
channel (empty fails boot); secrets in env / read-only mounts; manifest
membership **is** the grant; Distroless nonroot, no shell; `SELF.md` capped
~4KB (persona `:ro` disables it); memory inspectable and forgettable; drain
in-flight turn on SIGTERM.

**Residual (accepted):** prompt injection can still drive any mounted tool;
MCP children inherit process env unless the manifest overrides it; heartbeat
is liveness not Telegram/LLM health; caps bound context size, not spend.
Treat `mcp.toml` like a rootkit allowlist. Split containers for separate
trust domains.

Operator checklist: minimal numeric (or verified) allowlist; `.env` and
`/data` not world-readable; only the MCP servers this persona needs; persona
says “confirm before irreversible sends” if you care; rebuild image + MCP
binaries from known sources.

MCP grant: [mcp.md](mcp.md).
