# MCP host

How the harness loads tools, names them for the model, recovers from common
hallucinations, and how to exercise that path locally.

Capabilities live in **external MCP stdio binaries**, plus a few harness
builtins (memory, cron, watch, `self_note`, `web_search`). The host
supervises MCP children: spawn → list → call → truncate → restart. See
[architecture.md](architecture.md) for the process diagram; this page is the
operator contract for naming and local use.

Long-horizon planning uses tools over days (cron, watches). The host has to
repair names and finish turns or the horizon collapses into ERROR.

## Why MCP (and nothing else)

| Goal | How MCP helps |
| --- | --- |
| Keep the harness small | Calendar, Cast, etc. stay out of `george`. Web search is a builtin. |
| Clear grant model | A server in `mcp.toml` is granted; omit it and it does not exist |
| Distroless-friendly | Static Go binaries over stdio — no shell, no npm in the image |
| Swappable brains | Same tool schemas work for Gemini, ChatGPT, Ollama — OpenAI-compat tool calls |

Chat, memory, cron, and web search work with **zero** MCP servers. Other tools are optional.

---

## Naming: `{server}__{tool}`

**Authoring new MCP tools?** Follow the shared package contract:
[mcp-naming.md](mcp-naming.md) (`{service}_{verb}_{object}`, no server-id in the
tool name, stable verbs, sibling nouns). This section is the **host** side.

Every published tool reaches the model as:

```text
{server_or_tools_prefix}__{original_tool_name}
```

Examples:

| Manifest `name` | MCP tool | Name the model must call |
| --- | --- | --- |
| *(builtin)* | `web_search` | `web_search` (always on; no prefix) |
| `google` | `calendar_list_events` | `google__calendar_list_events` |
| `math` | `expression_evaluate` | `math__expression_evaluate` |
| `youtube` | `videos_search` | `youtube__videos_search` |
| `cast` | `youtube_beam_video` | `cast__youtube_beam_video` |
| `garmin` | `sleep_get` | `garmin__sleep_get` |
| `strava` | `activities_list`, `urls_resolve` | `strava__activities_list` |
| `feeds` | `items_list` | `feeds__items_list` |
| `twitter` | `posts_list` | `twitter__posts_list` |
| `maps` | `place_search`, `route_eta` | `maps__place_search` |
| `image` | `photo_generate`, `photo_edit` | `image__photo_generate` |
| `pendant` | `avatar_update`, `theme_list` | `pendant__avatar_update` |
| `boards` | `challenges_list` | `boards__challenges_list` |

MCP `ImageContent` (image-generation-mcp) is **not** stuffed into the model
prompt — hosts truncate tool results. The JSON summary stays; Telegram /
Discord / Slack `SendPhoto` the PNG; pendant puts `images: [{ url }]` on the
mailbox reply (same shape as inbound). Grant prefix `image` (not fat `google`).
Image bytes that another tool must read go to disk via `IMAGE_OUTPUT_DIR`;
downstream tools (pendant `avatar_update` / `backdrop_update`) take `source_path`.

**Why the prefix?** OpenAI-safe characters, no collisions across servers, and
obvious provenance in logs / collapsed history markers.

Optional override in `mcp.toml`:

```toml
[[server]]
name = "garmin"
tools_prefix = "garm"   # tools become garm__sleep_get, …
```

Default prefix is the server `name`. Prefer short, stable prefixes when a
hyphenated product name fights the model (see below).

Inspect what the running agent sees:

- Telegram / Discord / Slack / stdio: `/tools` (total + per-server `schema_est_tokens`)
- `/status` includes `schema_est_tokens` alongside history size
- Boot logs: `mcp server connected` (`tools_listed` vs `tools_published`), then
  `tool schema estimate` + one `tool schema by server` line per prefix
- **Fail-soft boot:** if one `[[server]]` fails to spawn/initialize (missing API
  key, broken binary, EOF), george logs `mcp server boot skipped` with a stable
  `reason` (`no_binary` / `no_key` / `no_oauth` / `connect`) and continues.
  Calling a skipped prefix returns `tool error [<reason>]: … is skipped — do
  not invent <name>__* names`. A single optional tool must not take down the
  agent.

---

## Local models and hyphenated prefixes

Server names can use hyphens. Tool *suffixes* use underscores. Small local
models (e.g. Qwen via Ollama) frequently **normalize the whole name to
underscores** and invent nearby names.

Web search is the unprefixed builtin `web_search` (Brave Search HTTP —
titles, URLs, snippets). Leftover MCP names (`google-search__web_search`,
`google_search__web_search`) still call that builtin; they are not a second
model.

Typical hyphen-prefix failure spiral (why search is a builtin now):

1. Model calls `google-search__google_search` → unknown tool (invented suffix)
2. Host suggests a catalog name; model rewrites the prefix to underscores
3. Hint degrades to a bare prefix list → more guessing → think-stall

That is a **runtime** problem, not a persona typo. Exact names come from the
live catalog (tool schemas + `[mcp prefixes]` + `/tools`); the host also
hardens the call path.

### Alias resolve (automatic)

On `Call`, if the exact name is missing, george rewrites **only the server
prefix** so underscores become hyphens, then retries lookup:

```text
google_search__web_search  →  builtin web_search   ✅ called
```

Tool suffixes are **not** rewritten (`calendar_list_events` stays
`calendar_list_events`). Search aliases are handled by the builtin, not by
prefix rewrite.

A real tool name wearing an invented or missing prefix is repaired the same way,
because a bounced call costs a full model round-trip — the most expensive thing
in a local-model turn:

```text
mcp__hrv_get  →  garmin__hrv_get   ✅ called
hrv_get       →  garmin__hrv_get   ✅ called
```

Two cases are left to the model on purpose:

- **Real prefix, wrong tool** (`garmin__athlete_get` when only Strava has it).
  The model chose that server deliberately, so it gets that server's catalog
  rather than a silent hop to a different server.
- **Two servers publish the name** (`activities_get` on both Garmin and Strava).
  Guessing is a coin flip, so both real names go back as a hint.

When any repair fires, logs show:

```text
mcp tool name aliased  requested=…  resolved=…
```

### Unknown-tool suggestions

If lookup still fails, the error string is model-facing and catalog-aware:

| Mistake | Hint shape |
| --- | --- |
| Wrong tool, real prefix | `valid garmin tools are: garmin__hrv_get — retry with one of these exact names` |
| Underscored prefix, wrong tool | `did you mean "garmin"?` + that server’s exact tool list |
| Invented name (fake prefix, merged suffix) | `closest real names are: garmin__wellness_get_body_battery, garmin__hrv_get — retry with one of these exact names` |
| Unknown prefix, nothing close | `available server prefixes are: cast, garmin, google, …` |

The agent loop feeds that error back as a tool result so the next iteration
can self-correct (same pattern as argument/schema failures).

Closest-name ranking scores shared name tokens, ignoring generic verbs (`get`,
`list`, `set`, …) that would otherwise match everything. A model that invents a
tool tends to stitch real fragments together — `mcp__get_hrv_and_body_battery`
is `get_hrv` plus `get_body_battery` under a prefix that does not exist — so the
fragments identify what it was reaching for even when neither prefix nor suffix
is real.

### Printed tool calls

A model can also skip the `tool_calls` field entirely and *print* the call:

```json
{ "name": "garmin__get_daily_activity", "parameters": { "date": "2026-07-28" } }
```

Without handling, that JSON is just assistant text, so it becomes the visible
reply — the agent answering in wire format. george parses it back into a real
call and runs it, accepting the object bare, fenced, inside `<tool_call>` tags,
or embedded in prose, with arguments under `arguments`, `parameters`, `args`, or
`input` (models pick all of them).

```text
model printed a tool call instead of emitting one; executing it  name=… chars=90
```

The name must look like a tool — published, or at least carrying a `server__`
prefix — so an ordinary reply that happens to contain JSON is never hijacked. An
unpublished but prefixed name is still run on purpose: the host's answer is what
names the real tools, which feeds the retry below.

### Grammar-constrained retry

A hint only works if the model reads it. When a name cannot be resolved *and*
there are real candidates, the next model call is constrained instead: george
sends `response_format` with a JSON schema whose `name` is an `enum` of those
candidates. Ollama compiles that to a GBNF grammar and masks every token that
would spell anything else, so a bad name stops being unlikely and becomes
impossible.

```text
tool call failed        name=mcp__get_hrv_and_body_battery
constraining retry …    requested=mcp__get_hrv_and_body_battery candidates=2
model call              iteration=2 forced_tool_names=2
```

Three details make it work:

- **`tools` stays in the request.** The model reads real parameter schemas from
  there. Drop it and the name is still legal but the arguments are invented
  (measured on Qwen: `start_date`/`end_date` instead of `date`).
- **The call arrives in `content`, not `tool_calls`.** Ollama omits `tool_calls`
  whenever a `response_format` is set (still true in 0.32.4), so the provider
  parses the JSON object back into a `ToolCall`.
- **It is one-shot, and never streams.** A grammar forces *every* reply to be
  JSON, so leaving it on would make conversational answers impossible; and
  streaming it would type raw JSON into the user's bubble.

No candidates means no constraint — forcing a call out of the whole catalog is
just a different guess.

### What aliasing does *not* fix

- Invented tool suffixes (`…__google_search`) — no real name to repair to, so these
  still need a retry with the suggested name (or a smaller published tool surface)
- Wrong arguments (e.g. passing a time range as `event_id`) — MCP/API errors
- Think-only turns with no tool call — agent nudge / stall path in
  `internal/agent` (separate from naming)
- A model that neither calls nor prints anything callable — still a nudge, then
  the turn answers with whatever prose it has

## Manifest filters

Listed servers **start**. `tools` / `exclude` only filter what is **published**
to the model:

```toml
[[server]]
name = "garmin"
command = "garmin"
args = ["mcp"]
tools = ["get_sleep", "get_weight", "get_hrv"]  # allowlist
# exclude = ["raw_*"]
```

Boot logs `tools_listed` vs `tools_published`. Schema cost is estimated as
`est_tokens` (chars/4); `TOOL_SCHEMA_MAX_TOKENS` can hard-fail an oversized set.
Prefer MCP-native tiers (`--tool-tier core`) first — [design.md](design.md#decisions).

### Call budget (`budget`)

A metered API — rentals, flights, cars on a 50-requests-a-month plan — gets
its quota written into the manifest, and the host enforces it:

```toml
[[server]]
name = "rentals"
command = "rentals-search-mcp"
budget = "1/day"        # or "50/month"
```

Why the host and not the prompt: the model is not the only caller, and it
is not a careful one. In the behavioral eval a single "I need to be in
Denver Friday" produced three to five `flights__search` calls in one turn.
A `watch_add` that omits `interval` polls every **15 minutes** — 96 calls a
day, a monthly quota gone before lunch. The daily planner reaches for live tools
too. Every one of those paths ends in the same `Host.call`, so that is
where the counter sits, after argument validation (a malformed call spends
nothing) and before the child is touched (a refused call never reaches the
vendor).

- Counted per server per period in `george.db` (`mcp_budget`), so a
  monthly cap survives a redeploy. The day rolls at the **human's**
  midnight (`[timezone]`), the month on their first.
- Over budget, the tool result is a refusal that names the reset and says
  not to retry: `mcp: rentals budget 1/day used (1 calls this day); resets
  2026-09-16 00:00 PDT — do not retry; use what you already have and tell
  the human`. The model reports instead of burning.
- `watch_add` on a budgeted server raises a shorter interval to the floor
  (`1/day` → 24h; `50/month` → 14h24m) and says so in its reply. A watch
  that still hits the wall — one created before the budget existed — is
  parked until the reset instead of re-polling every tick; it stays
  enabled and keeps its cursor.
- `/tools` shows `budget_refused=N` once anything has been turned away.

The count is of attempts: a call the vendor rejects still spent a slot,
because it almost certainly spent one of theirs.

### Prefix enable (`dynamic_tools`)

By default (`dynamic_tools` omitted or `true`) MCP schemas stay **off** until
the agent calls `mcp_enable` (list of prefixes, next Completer call in the
same turn). The prompt lists on vs off under `[mcp prefixes]` and tells the
model to review that list and enable a needed off prefix this turn. Brief hold
idles out at 6h (morning/afternoon); short at 27h. Harness builtins stay on.
Go-live is from zero — no seed of today's catalog.

Small models / rollback — full catalog every turn, no `mcp_enable`:

```toml
dynamic_tools = false
```

Furniture that should never idle-drop while dynamic tools are on:

```toml
[[server]]
name = "google"
force = true          # whole server prefix; pair with a tight `tools` allowlist
```

Or `MCP_ENABLE_FORCE=google__calendar,garmin__sleep`. Human overrides:
`/brief` `/short` `/off`. `/tools` shows published vs available.

## Using this locally

### A — REPL (fastest feedback)

```bash
# from repo root
make init          # deploy/persona + deploy/mcp.toml
# edit deploy/mcp.toml — uncomment / add servers you have binaries for
# edit .env — LLM_* (Gemini, Ollama, …)

make run           # CHANNEL=stdio by default
```

In the REPL:

```text
/status     # model, history, tool count
/tools      # exact prefixed catalog the model sees
```

Ask something that needs a tool (“search for …”, “what’s on my calendar
today”). Watch stderr JSON for `tool call`, `mcp tool name aliased`, or
`tool call failed` with the suggestion string.

Override mounts:

```bash
# Windows PowerShell example
$env:CHANNEL="stdio"
$env:PERSONA_DIR="./deploy/persona"
$env:MCP_MANIFEST="./deploy/mcp.toml"
make run
```

MCP servers stay commented until you grant them. Trust `/tools` plus the
alias and suggestion strings when the model mangles a hyphen. Do not copy
the MCP catalog into `PERSONA.md`.

### Unit tests (no LLM)

```bash
go test ./internal/mcp/ -count=1
```

Covers catalog suggestions, underscore-prefix aliasing, and “did you mean”
hints without spawning real MCP binaries.

## Operator checklist

- [ ] Only list servers this persona should have (`mcp.toml` = grant)
- [ ] Prefer MCP `--tool-tier` / `tools = […]` so Flash/local models see tens of tools, not hundreds
- [ ] After deploy, `/tools` once and confirm the published names
- [ ] On weird tool loops: check logs for `aliased` vs repeated `unknown tool`
- [ ] Static MCP binaries only if you ship distroless (no libc/shell for children)
