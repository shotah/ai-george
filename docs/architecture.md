# Architecture

george is a single static Go binary — an **AI harness** that hosts one
persona, one LLM endpoint, and a set of MCP tool processes so the agent can
**plan on a long horizon**. Scaling is horizontal: one container (or systemd
unit) per brain. Harness contract (env, loop, memory):
[design.md](design.md). Hello path: [root readme](../readme.md).
Pendant, Cab, and gantree stay their own repos. This process does not import them.

## Container view

  M1 --- S[("secrets / .config")]
```

Nothing listens inbound. Health is `george status` (exit code) reading a
heartbeat row in SQLite — Docker exec form, no shell. Persona is writable when
self-notes are on (`SELF.md`); `:ro` disables that feature.

## Package layout

```text
cmd/george/          run | init | auth | status | version
cmd/release/         semver bump → tag → push (dev tooling)
internal/config/     env parse + fail-fast validation
internal/channel/    Channel interface; telegram/, discord/, slack/, pendant/, stdio/
internal/provider/   OpenAI-compatible Completer (one implementation)
internal/mcp/        manifest, spawn, list/call tools, truncate, restart
internal/mcpenable/  dynamic tool prefix grants
internal/agent/      prompt assembly, tool loop, collapse, reply
internal/session/    bounded history + rolling summary
internal/memory/     Memory interface, builtin SQLite/FTS5, MCP adapter, consolidator
internal/persona/    load PERSONA.md + SELF.md
internal/selfnote/   SELF.md tool + distill on /new
internal/websearch/  builtin web_search (Brave Search HTTP)
internal/heartbeat/  singleton row for Docker healthcheck
internal/drain/      in-flight turn wait on SIGTERM
internal/cron/       scheduled turns → agent → channel push
internal/watch/      poll MCP fetch tools; wake only on new item ids
internal/examples/   /examples capability pings
internal/logfwd/     optional slog → chat
```

One provider implementation is deliberate: Gemini, ChatGPT, and local models all
speak OpenAI-compat. Model identity is `LLM_BASE_URL` + `LLM_MODEL` +
`LLM_API_KEY`.

## Process model (goroutines)

One OS process. Concurrent work:

| Goroutine | Job |
| --- | --- |
| channel poller | Telegram `getUpdates` / Discord Gateway / Slack Socket Mode / pendant mailbox WSS (`cmds` then `allow` on dial) / stdio; allowlist filter |
| agent handler | per message: assemble → model → tools → reply; follow-ups settle then steer the live turn (Telegram: workers=2 so `/cancel` + barge-in can run) |
| MCP children | one OS process per manifest server (stdio), supervised by host |
| heartbeat ticker | upsert `heartbeat` every ~15s |
| memory consolidator | optional timer (`MEMORY_CONSOLIDATE_MINUTES`; `0` = off) |
| cron + watch tickers | clock jobs → agent → push; fetch-tool polls → wake only on new ids |

## Boot sequence

```mermaid

  participant OS
  participant Run as george run
  participant Cfg as config
  participant Ses as session
  participant HB as heartbeat
  participant MCP as mcp.Host
  participant Mem as memory
  participant Ch as channel

  OS->>Run: start
  Run->>Cfg: Load env (fail-fast)
  Run->>Ses: Open george.db + migrations
  Run->>Ses: WithSummarizer(LLM)
  Run->>HB: OpenDB + Start ticker
  Run->>MCP: Start(manifest) — connect all servers or exit 1
  alt MEMORY_ENABLED

      Run->>Mem: Consolidator.Start
    end
  end
  Run->>Ch: Run(ctx, drain.Handler(agent.Handle))
  Note over Ch: blocks until SIGTERM / cancel
```

## Message / agent loop

One turn is execution. Long-horizon planning is those turns chained across
memory, cron, watches, and `SELF.md` — same loop, later.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant U as User
  participant Ch as channel
  participant A as agent
  participant M as memory
  participant S as session
  participant L as LLM
  participant T as mcp / memory tools

  U->>Ch: inbound message
  Ch->>A: Handle(ctx, msg)
  alt /new or /status
    A->>S: Reset or Stats
    A-->>Ch: short reply
  else chat turn
    A->>S: Messages + Summary
    A->>M: Hydrate(query, ~30)
    A->>A: assemble system blocks + history + user
    loop until final text (at TOOL_MAX_ITERATIONS a no-tools landing call forces one)
      A->>A: collapse tool results from rounds older than the last 2 (and stub their args)
      A->>L: Complete(messages, tool schemas)
      alt tool_calls (one parallel batch)
        loop concurrent batch (results stay in call order)
          A->>T: Call(name, args)
          T-->>A: truncated result
        end
      else text
        A-->>Ch: reply
        A->>S: Append user+assistant (may trim → fold summary)
      end
    end
  end
  Ch-->>U: outbound reply
```

## MCP tool call (resolve → call → restart)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant A as agent
  participant H as mcp.Host
  participant C as child Conn

  A->>H: Call("server__tool", args)
  H->>H: resolve exact name, else hyphenate prefix (_→-)
  alt unknown after resolve
    H-->>A: error + catalog suggestion (model-facing)
  else known
    H->>C: CallTool(originalName, args)
    alt success
      C-->>H: text
      H-->>A: Truncate(text, TOOL_RESULT_MAX_CHARS)
    else failure
      H->>H: restartServer (backoff ≤ 4 attempts)
      H->>C: CallTool again
      C-->>H: text or error
      H-->>A: result / error string
    end
  end
```

Children are **not** bound to the signal context. On SIGTERM the channel
stops accepting work, `drain.Gate` waits for the in-flight turn (default 2m),
then deferred `mcp.Host.Close()` tears down stdio sessions (killing children).

Operator details (naming, local REPL, why alias exists): [mcp.md](mcp.md).

## Data on disk

One WAL SQLite file: `$DATA_DIR/george.db`.

| Table | Owner package | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `session` / `session_message` | `session` | history + rolling `summary` |
| `memory` / `memory_fts` | `memory` | structured long-term memory |
| `heartbeat` | `heartbeat` | singleton row for `george status` |
| cron / watch job rows | `cron` / `watch` | scheduled turns and fetch-tool cursors |

`SELF.md` lives in `PERSONA_DIR`, not SQLite. `/new` deletes the session row
(cascade messages + summary) after `Voice:` merges into `SELF.md` and
`Facts:` park as a memory episode. Memory rows are untouched.

## Prompt assembly (order)

1. System: `PERSONA.md` then `SELF.md` (+ memory persona-precedence note when memory on)
2. System: `[session summary]` (optional)
3. System: `[mcp prefixes]` when dynamic tools are on
4. History: user/assistant turns (bounded; trailing cron `— tools:` audit line stripped, footer-only assistant turns omitted)
5. System: `[memory]` hydration block (optional, ≤ ~30 rows; after history so the prefix stays cacheable)
6. System: MCP server health (when tools are wired)
7. User: current message (typed words / `[photo]` / steers only)
8. System: `[harness]` location + `[current time]` + `[hours]` + `[aims]` (rating suffix when the ledger has rows) + `[todo]` (the pocket list, oldest first, with row ids) + `[progress]` on the daily planner turn only (week lines on the week-start planner only) + `[loops]` (prompt-only; not session history)
9. System: follow-up / conversation / `mcp_enable` review / cron tool-first notes as applicable

Tool schemas are attached on the completion request, not as chat messages.
Clock used to ride on the user body; that leaked into “raw message text.”

Read the completed Completer request (not the inserts): PWA inbound JSON
in `internal/agent/testdata/pendant/inbound_geo.json` is parsed by
`pendant.InboundTurn`, run through `Handle`, and pinned as
`completer_geo.txt` (agent layout) and `completer_geo_gemini_wire.txt`
(Gemini OpenAI-compat body). GPS-off is `inbound_nogeo.json` /
`completer_nogeo.txt`. Gate: `TestPendantInbound_CompleterPayload`. Clock
is frozen at 2026-09-14 12:02 PDT so the dump is stable. Production
`CRON_TZ` still uses `time.Now`. Memory hydration, `[hours]`, MCP health,
wait notes, and tool schemas are omitted there so the mouth contract is
readable; they still append after this prefix when those subsystems are on.
Hours, aims, and loops need Memory: `completer_horizon_harness.txt`. The
whole board — memory, cron `[wakes]`, Cab `[surface]`, pendant `[room]`
(the channel's cached face / backdrop / theme notices, stamped only when
`pendant__*` is in the catalog), `[last contact]` — is
`completer_fullboard_harness.txt`. `prompt_wire_test.go` posts the same
turn through a real `provider.Client` to an `httptest` server and diffs
the HTTP body against those same goldens, so agent layout and wire cannot
drift apart. `go test ./internal/agent/ -run Payload -update` rewrites
goldens; read the diff before trusting it.

The `[harness]` header names only the tags present (`location and clock`
on a memory-off turn; `location, clock, hours, horizon, wakes, surface,
input, room, and last contact` on the full board, where the Cab Auto
fixture carries `input: spoken`). A planner turn adds `progress`.
`[aims]` / `[todo]` / `[loops]` carry `(12d
ago)` from `updated_at` after the first day, `[loops]` past three weeks add
`— resolve or memory_forget`, and all three say `(+N more — …)`
instead of truncating silently. `[todo]` carries no stale cue: a task the
human has not done is still a task. Rows already
on `[aims]` / `[todo]` / `[loops]` are dropped from `[memory]` hydration. `[hours]` is skipped (not "unknown")
when the backend cannot do a live-row lookup (`memory.ErrNotSupported`,
MCP memory).

Gemini's OpenAI-compat layer keeps **one** system instruction. A trailing
`[harness]` `role=system` after the user is dropped or overwrites the
persona — Tim never sees NOW/GPS without a tool. `provider.WireMessages`
folds every system block into one leading system message for `gemini*`
models: standing blocks (persona, summary, hydration) first so identity
leads and the stable prefix stays cacheable, this-turn blocks (`[harness]`,
wait note) last for recency. OpenAI/Ollama keep the trailing system (prefix
cache). `LLM_SYSTEM_FOLD=auto|one|many` overrides the model-name guess —
`one` for a local chat template that renders system only at position 0.

## External dependencies (import over write)

| Concern | Library | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| MCP client | `github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk` | Official SDK; stdio transport, schema handling |
| SQLite | `modernc.org/sqlite` | Pure Go (no CGO), FTS5 works, one file DB |
| Telegram | `github.com/go-telegram/bot` | Zero-dep, maintained, long-poll native |
| LLM client | `github.com/openai/openai-go/v3` | Official; custom `base_url` covers Gemini, xAI, Ollama |
| Env config | `github.com/caarlos0/env/v11` | Struct tags → env, tiny |
| MCP manifest | `github.com/pelletier/go-toml/v2` | Minimal TOML for `mcp.toml` |
| Logging | stdlib `log/slog` | JSON to **stderr** (stdio REPL stays clean) |

Why each pick stuck: [design.md](design.md#decisions).

## Cron push

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant U as User
  participant A as agent
  participant C as cron
  participant T as Telegram

  U->>A: "remind me at 5pm to…"
  A->>C: cron_schedule(...)
  Note over C: SQLite job row + next_run
  C->>C: ticker: job due
  C->>A: Handle(synthetic prompt)
  A->>A: tools / MCP as usual
  A->>T: push SendMessage (no inbound update)
  T-->>U: reminder / digest / daily planner (or skip on [silent])
```

Outbound push needs a channel API beyond “reply to the update that invoked
Handle” — Telegram chat/user id is stored with the job from the scheduling turn.

## Event watches

Poller is code, not the agent. Quiet ticks never call the Completer.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant T as ticker
  participant H as MCP Host
  participant W as watch
  participant A as agent
  participant C as channel

  T->>W: due rows
  W->>H: Call(tool, args)
  H-->>W: items JSON
  alt first poll or no new ids
    W->>W: seed / update cursor
  else new ids
    W->>A: Handle([watch] items)
    A-->>W: reply or [silent]
    opt not silent
      W->>C: Push
    end
  end
```

A quiet watch polls a tool and does not call the model.

## Streaming replies

Default on: `STREAM_REPLIES=true`. Channel attaches a `ReplyWriter`; agent uses
`provider.CompleteStream` when available.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant L as LLM stream
  participant A as agent
  participant T as Telegram

  A->>T: SendMessage("…")
  loop token chunks
    L-->>A: delta
    A->>T: editMessageText (throttled)
  end
  A->>T: Finish (final text; overflow as extra messages)
```

Finish is the last **visible** step. `sessions.Append` and wait-cron
`AfterReply` run after it so a complete draft is not stuck italic while
SQLite fold or cron work happens. Tool-call chunks skip live text
updates; cron push stays buffered.
